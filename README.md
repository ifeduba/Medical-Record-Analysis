# Medical Record  Analysis

# Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing key aspects of a health care dataset—including patient demographics, medical conditions, medications, and hospital visits—to uncover patterns, assess performance, and support evidence-based insights.
By applying data analysis techniques such as aggregation, visualization, and statistical modeling, this analysis aims to identify the most common health issues, monitor treatment trends, evaluate patient outcomes, and highlight areas for operational improvement. The ultimate goal is to leverage data to support better patient care, resource allocation, and strategic planning within health care systems.


## Key metrics
- What are the most common diagnoses based on region?
-  What are the success rates of the various treatment plans?
-  What are the demographics (age, gender) of patients with specific health condion?
-   Patient demographics distribution across different health conditions.
- Treatment success rates by diagnosis.
- Geographical distribution of health conditions.
  



## Skills  and concept demostrated
The following excel and tableau features were incoporated:
- Data gathering
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Data visualization
- Quick measures and dashboard automation.

  ## Visualization
  visualization and analysis.

  ### The Analysis
 - The most common health conditions listed are Obesity, Asthma, Cancer, and Diabetes. Obesity appears to be a particularly common condition across the patients in this dataset.
Hypertension and Arthritis are also notable conditions, especially among older patients
 
- The percentage of all health condition are all within the same range of 16.5% to 16.7%. and there is no geographical distribution in the dataset .
- the analysis  shows that male gender have more of the health condition than female gender  though the region wasn’t given . there are also high rate  arthritis in female than in male.
- The percentage of all health condition are all within the same range of 16.5% to 16.7%. and there is no geographical distribution in the dataset . during the analysis I disfigured that Arthritis patients that was given Lipitor has the lowest abnormal test result  than other medications like paracetemol, aspirin, ibuprofen and penicillin.
- In terms of asthmatic patients those patients given aspirin has the lowest abnormal result compare to those given other medications. Which shows the aspirin works more on asthmatic patients than other medications.  Also in cancer patients , patients given aspirin and penicillin has lower abnormal result compare to others. Diabetes patients respond more Lipitor .

  ### Insight
   The dataset contains both male and female patients, with a slight skew toward females (approximately 60% of the records).
Patient ages range from 20 to 82, indicating a broad spectrum of age groups. A majority of the patients seem to be older adults (over 50 years).

## Conclusion and Recommendation
- Promote Gender-Specific Healthcare Interventions
Since male patients exhibit a higher frequency of general health conditions, and females show higher rates of arthritis, healthcare providers should design gender-sensitive programs. For example, arthritis awareness and preventive strategies can be targeted specifically at female patients, while general screening and health education can be intensified for male patients.
- Optimize Medication Prescription Practices
The analysis revealed that Lipitor was most effective for arthritis and diabetes, while aspirin showed better results in asthma and cancer cases. Medical practitioners should re-evaluate treatment protocols to consider these findings when prescribing medications. However, these insights should also be supported by clinical trials or further investigation before being widely implemented.
- Focus on Older Adult Health
With the majority of patients aged 50 and above, healthcare planning should prioritize elderly care. This includes increasing access to chronic disease screening, medication management programs, and regular health monitoring for this age group.
- Enhance Data Collection and Management Systems
To strengthen future analyses, healthcare institutions should maintain consistent and complete electronic health records (EHRs) with standardized data types, units, and formats. Regular audits and data validation processes should be enforced to ensure high-quality datasets.
- Encourage Further Research into Drug Efficacy
The correlation between specific medications and lower abnormal results suggests a need for deeper clinical research into these drugs' performance across different conditions. Healthcare organizations should support studies that explore why certain medications perform better in certain demographics.
